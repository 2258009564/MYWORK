Alice's friend is a big fan of the Adrenaline Rush racing competition and always strives to attend every race. However, this time, Alice is the one watching the race. To ensure her friend does not miss any important details, Alice decides to take notes on everything that happens on the track.

The first thing Alice notices before the race begins is the numbering of the cars. All the cars line up in front of the starting line in a specific order. The car closest to the line is numbered $1$, the second car is numbered $2$, and so on, up to the last car, which is numbered $n$. How convenient! — Alice thought.

The race begins with the countdown: "Three! Two! One! Go!". Alice observes that the cars start in their original order. However, as the race progresses, their order changes. She records whenever one car overtakes another, essentially swapping places with it on the track.

During the race, Alice notices something curious: no car overtakes another more than once. In other words, for any two cars $x$ and $y$, there are at most two overtakes between them during the race: "$x$ overtakes $y$" and/or "$y$ overtakes $x$".

At the end of the race, Alice carefully writes down the final order of the cars $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$, where $c_1$ represents the winner of the race.

Alice's friend, however, is only interested in the final ranking and discards all of Alice's notes except for the final ordering. As Alice is quite curious, she wonders: What is the longest possible sequence of overtakes she could have observed during the race? Your task is to help Alice answer this question.

一堆车 编号是1~n 第一个车最先出去 但到达终点的时候顺序被打乱了 我们可以关注到 对于一个车k 如果最后编号比他大的在他后面 那或许发生了2次超车（超过去再超回来） 而最后编号比他小的在他后面 就意味着只发生了一次超越
维护一个vis数组 遍历最后的序列 对于所有的车 如果在他后面而且没访问过 那么就可以进行一次超车；倒序超车回来即可
```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;
vector<int> c(n + 1, 0);
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) cin >> c[i];
vector<int> vis(n + 1, 0);
vector<pair<int, int>> ans;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
{
	vis[c[i]] = 1; // 标记为已经出场
	for (int j = c[i] + 1, j <= n; j++)
	{
		if (!vis[j])
		{
			ans.emplace_back(j, c[i]); // 后面的车超过当前的
		}
	}
	for (int j = n; j >= 1; j--)
	{
		if (!vis[j])
		{
			ans.emplace_back(c[i], j); // 当前的超回来 或者 超过前面的
		}
	}
}

// 输出
```

A batch of Christmas trees has arrived at the largest store in Berland. $n$ customers have already come to the store, wanting to buy them.

Before the sales begin, the store needs to determine the price for one tree (the price is the same for all customers). To do this, the store has some information about each customer.

For the $i$\-th customer, two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ are known, which define their behavior:

-   if the price of the product is at most $a_i$, the customer will buy a tree and leave a positive review;
-   otherwise, if the price of the product is at most $b_i$, the customer will buy a tree but leave a negative review;
-   otherwise, the customer will not buy a tree at all.

Your task is to calculate the maximum possible earnings for the store, given that it can receive no more than $k$ negative reviews.

- customer 顾客

扫描线算法 是什么原理
> 扫描线算法通过把高维问题拆成“沿某方向”的事件排序+动态维护一维结构，将复杂问题化繁为简，常用于几何求交、覆盖面积、最近对、可视化剖分等场景
> which is from GPT

我慢慢领略吧

```cpp
int n, k;
cin >> n >> k;

vector<pair<int, int>> v;
vector<int> a(n), b = a;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
	cin >> a[i];
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
	cin >> b[i];
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
	v.emplace_back(a[i], 1); // 类型1 超过a[i] 留下负面评价
	v.emplace_back(b[i], 2); // 类型2 超过b[i] 不再购买
}

sort(all(v), [](auto a, auto b)
	 { return a.first == b.first ? a.second < b.second : a.first < b.first; });

int ans = 0, cnt = n, bad = 0; // 初始化所有人都购买 没有人负面评价

for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n;) // 本质上是枚举价格
{
	auto &&[x, y] = v[i];
	if (bad <= k)
	{
		ans = max(ans, x * 1ll * cnt);
	}

	while (i < 2 * n and v[i].first == x)
	{
		bad += (v[i].second == 1); // 如果是类型1事件，bad++
		bad -= (v[i].second == 2); // 如果是类型2事件，bad--
		cnt -= (v[i].second == 2); // 如果是类型2事件，cnt--
		i++;
	}
}

cout << ans;

Kevin used to get into Rio's Memories, and in Rio's Memories, a series of contests was once held. Kevin remembers all the participants and all the contest problems from that time, but he has forgotten the specific rounds, the distribution of problems, and the exact rankings.

There are $m$  problems in total, with the $i$ -th problem having a difficulty of $b_i$  . Let each contest consist of $k$  problems, resulting in a total of $\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor$  contests. This means that you select exactly $\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$  problems for the contests in any combination you want, with each problem being selected at most once, and the remaining $m\bmod k$ problems are left unused. For example, if $m = 17$ and $k = 3$, you should create exactly $5$ contests consisting of $3$ problems each, and exactly $2$ problems will be left unused.

There are $n$  participants in the contests, with Kevin being the $1$-st participant. The $i$  -th participant has a rating of $a_i$  . During the contests, each participant solves all problems with a difficulty not exceeding their rating, meaning the $i$  -th participant solves the $j$  -th problem if and only if $a_i \geq b_j$  . In each contest, Kevin's rank is one plus the number of participants who solve more problems than he does.

For each $k = 1, 2, \ldots, m$  , Kevin wants to know the minimum sum of his ranks across all $\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor$  contests. In other words, for some value of $k$, after selecting the problems for each contest, you calculate the rank of Kevin in each contest and sum up these ranks over all $\lfloor \frac{m}{k} \rfloor$  contests. Your goal is to minimize this value.

Note that contests for different values of $k$ are independent. It means that for different values of $k$, you can select the distribution of problems into the contests independently.

- distribution 分布

阅读所有提示。先删除所有 rating 低于你的参赛者，这样你就成了 rating 最低的参赛者。此时你能解决的问题所有人都能解决，不影响你的排名，可以将这些问题的难度看作 +∞。
此时，你不能解决任何问题，因此你在一场比赛中的排名是 (1+ 在这张比赛中解决至少一个问题的参赛者数量 )，即我们只需要关注每场比赛中的最简单的问题。
预处理出对于每个问题，有多少参赛者能够解决，设为 ci​。可以通过将参赛者 rating 和题目难度排序后使用双指针或二分算法求出 ci​。
接下来的问题是，给定 ci​，你需要将所有 ci​ 分为 ⌊kn​⌋ 组，每组 k 个，最小化每组 ci​ 最大值之和。可以使用贪心算法解决，将 ci​ 从小到大排序，对于一个 k，答案就是 (ck​+1)+(c2k​+1)+…，暴力计算复杂度是调和级数，算上排序后即为 O(nlogn+mlogm)。
```cpp
int n, m;
cin >> n >> m;
vector<int> a, b(m);
int u;
cin >> u;
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
{
	int num;
	cin >> num;
	if (num >= u)
	{
		a.emplace_back(num);
	}
}
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
{
	cin >> b[i];
	if (b[i] <= u)
	{
		b[i] = (1ll << 30);
	}
}
sort(all(a));                 // 多少人比自己nb
sort(all(b), greater<int>()); // 多少道题可以写
int tot = a.size();

// 对于每个i，计算并输出结果
for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
{
	int sum = 0;
	for (int j = i - 1; j < m; j += i)
	{
		sum += tot - (lower_bound(all(a), b[j]) - a.begin()) + 1;
	}
	cout << sum << " \n"[i == m];
}
